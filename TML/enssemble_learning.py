'''
Supose you've trained a few classifiers (Logistic regression, SVM, random forest, KNN, ect),
each one achieving about 80% accuracy. A very simple way to create an even better classifier
is to agregate the predictions of each classifier and predict the class that gets the most votes.
this majority-vote classifier is called a hard voting classifier.

Bagging and pasting
-------------------
The example above train different predictor on the same dataset.
This is one way to get a diverse set of predictors.
Another way is to train the same predictor on different random subset of the training set.
When this sampling (of training set) is performed with replacement (bootstraping), this method is called
bagging, otherwise it is called pasting.
The following code train an enssemble of 500 Decision trees classifiers, each trained on
100 instances randomly sampled from the training set with replecement (bootstrap = false),
if you set bootstrap to true, it will without replecement (pasting)
