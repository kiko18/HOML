Decision trees (like svm) are versatile ML algo that can perform both classification and regression tasks.
And even multi output task. They are very poweful algo capable of fitting complex datasets.

They are also the fundamental components of Random Forets, which are amoung the most powerful ML algo
available today.

One of the many qualities of Decision Trees is that they require very little data preparation. 
In particular, they don't require feature scaling or centering at all. On the other side, it makes very 
few assomptions about the training data as opposed to linear models for example, which obviously assume 
that the data is linear.

We can visualize the trained Decision Tree by first using the export_graphviz() method to output a graph
definition file .dot, then we can convert this file to a variety of format such as pdf or png using the
dot command-line tool from graphviz package:  dot -Tpng iris_tree.dot -o iris_tree.png

You first need to install graphviz with: conda install python-graphviz

Each node has 4 attributes:
    - samples:  how many training instances the node applies to
                For example, 50 training instances have a petal length smaller than 2.4
        
    - value:    how many training instances of each class the node applies to
    
    - gini:     Impurity of the node. 
                a node is pure (gini=0), if all training instances it applies to belong to the same class.
                The gini impurity measure is computed as follow: G(i) = 1 - sum(square(p_i,k))_k =1,...,n
                n is the number of classes, p_i,k = ratio of class k instances amoung the training 
                instances in the i^th node.
                For the depth-2 left node for example gini = 1 - (0/54)^2 - (49/54)^2 - (5/54)^2 = 0.168
                Note that 0/54=0% is the proba for setosa, 49/54=90.74% proba for versicolor, etc

Note that sklearn use CART algorithm, which produces only binary trees: nonleaf node always have two 
children (i.e., questions only have yes or no answers). However, other algorithms such as ID3 can produce 
Decision Trees with nodes that have more than 2 children.
'''


'''
Estimating class proba
----------------------
A decision Tree can also estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class k.
To do so, it traverse the tree to find the leaf node for this instance, then it return the ratio
of training instances of class k in this node, finally the instance is attributed to the class with
the highest ratio.
For example, supose we have find a flower whose petals are 5cm long and 1.5cm wide. 
The correpsonding leaf node is the depth-2 left node, so the decision tree should output following proba:
0% setosa (0/54), 90.7% versicolor (49/54), and 9.3% virginica (5/54). Therefore the predicted class
will then be iris-versicolor.

we can show that classifier will do better if we increase the depth of the tree.
Since it will therefore capture more information to be able to diferenciate between versicolor and virgina.
If we look at the previous figure we see that a flower with lengh 6cm and width 1.5cm is most likely a 
virgina, however, with a depth-2 classifier it will be classified as a versicolor (petal width < 1.75)

'''
hyperparams
-----------
Decision trees belong to the so called nonparametric model, not because it does not 
have any parameters (parameters to be learn) (it often has a lot) but because the 
number of parameters is not determined prior to training, so the model structure is 
free to stick closely to the training data, and most  likely overfiting it.

In contrast, a parametric model such as a linear model has a predetermined number of 
parameters, so its degree of freedom is limited, reducing the risk of overfitting 
(but increasing the risk of underfitting).

To avoid overfiting the training data, we need to restrict the Decision tree freedom 
during training. As we already know, this is called regularization. Some parameters, 
which we often restrict are:
    - max_deph: the maximum depth of the tree (default None -> unlimited)
                Reducing max_depth will regularize the model and thus reduce the risk
                of overfitting
                
    - min_samples_split: the minimun number of samples a node must have before it can 
                         be split
    - min_samples_leaf: the minimun number of samples a leaf node must have
    - max_features: the maximun number of features that are evaluated for spliting at 
                    each node
    
In the example above we classified the moons dataset with two diferent decision tree 
classifier, one with default hyperparams (no restritions), the other with 
min_samples_leaf = 4. As we see, the clf with no restrictions overfit the training 
data and will not generalize well.

Instability
-----------
Decision Tree are very simple to understand and interpret, easy to use, versatile and powerfull.
However they have a few limitations. In fact, they love orthogonal decision boundaries (all split
are perpendicular to an axis), which makes them sensitive to training set rotation.
For example the above figure show a very simple linear separable dataset.
On the left, a decision tree can split it easily, while on the right after the dataset is rotated 
by 45 degree, the decision boundary look unnecessary convoluted. although both decision Trees 
fit the training set perfectely, it is very likely that the model on the right will not generalize well.
One way to limit this problem is to use PCA, which often result in a better orientation of the training 
data.

More generally, decision tree are very sensitive to small variations in the training data.

Random forests can limit this instability by averaging predictions over many trees
