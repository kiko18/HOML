Q-Learning, as we covered in the previous part, is a robust machine learning algorithm. 
Unfortunately, Q-Learning requires that the Q-table contain an entry for every possible 
state that the environment can take. 

If the environment only includes a handful of discrete state elements, then traditional 
Q-learning might be a good learning algorithm. However, if the state space is large, 
the Q-table can become prohibitively large.

Creating policies for large state spaces is a task that Deep Q-Learning Networks (DQN) 
can usually handle. Unlike a table, a neural network does not require the program to 
represent every combination of state and action. Neural networks can generalize these 
states and learn commonalities. A DQN maps the state to its input neurons and the action 
Q-values to the output neurons. The DQN effectively becomes a function that accepts state 
and suggestions an action by returning the expected reward for each of the possible 
actions.

This chapter demonstrates playing Atari Pong. 
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. 
The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right 
side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on 
the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. 
The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; 
you earn points when one fails to return it to the other. 

For the Atari 2600 version of Pong, a computer player (controlled by the 2600) is the 
opposing player.

This section shows how to adapt TF-Agents to an Atari game. Some changes are necessary 
when compared to the pole-cart game presented earlier in this chapter. 
You can quickly adapt this example to any Atari game by simply changing the environment name. 
However, I tuned the code presented here for Pong, and it may not perform as well for other games. 
Some tuning will likely be necessary to produce a good agent for other games.

To apply DQN to this problem, you need to create the following components for TF-Agents.
1- Environment
2- Agent
3- Policies
4- Metrics and Evaluation
5- Replay Buffer
6- Data Collection
7- Training
These components are standard in most DQN implementations.

1 -Environment
--------------
TF-Agents uses OpenAI gym environments to represent the task or problem to be solved. 
Standard environments can be created in TF-Agents using tf_agents.environments suites. 
TF-Agents has suites for loading environments from sources such as the OpenAI Gym, Atari, 
and DM Control.

You must handle Atari environments differently than games like cart-poll. 
Atari games typically use their 2D displays as the environment state. 
AI Gym represents Atari games as either a 3D (height by width by color) state spaced based 
on their screens, or a vector representing the state of the game's computer RAM. 
To preprocess Atari games for greater computational efficiency, we generally skip several 
frames, decrease the resolution, and discard color information. The following code shows
 how we can set up an Atari environment.

# The more simple of the two parameters is fc_layer_params. This parameter specifies the size of

Metrics and Evaluation
----------------------
There are many different ways to measure the effectiveness of a model trained with reinforcement learning. 
The loss function of the internal Q-network is not a good measure of the entire DQN algorithm's overall fitness. 
The network loss function measures how close the Q-network was fit to the collected data and did not indicate 
how effective the DQN is in maximizing rewards. The method used for this example tracks the average reward received 
over several episodes.

'''
Replay Buffer
DQN works by training a neural network to predict the Q-values for every possible environment-state.
A neural network needs training data, so the algorithm accumulates this training data as it runs episodes. 
The replay buffer is where this data is stored. Only the most recent episodes are stored, 
older episode data rolls off the queue as the queue accumulates new data.
'''
replay_buffer = tf_uniform_replay_buffer.TFUniformReplayBuffer(
    # data_spec = The specification of the data that will be saved in the replay buffer. 
    # The DQN agent knowns what the collected data will look like, and it makes the data 
    # spec available via its collect_data_spec attribute, so that’s what we give the 
    # replay buffer.
    data_spec=agent.collect_data_spec,
    # batch_size = The number of trajectories that will be added at each step. 
    # In our case, it will be one, since the driver will just execute one action per step 
    # and collect one trajectory. If the environment were a batched environment, meaning 
    # an environment that takes a batch of actions at each step and returns a batch of 
    # observations, then the driver would have to save a batch of trajectories at each step.

# Dataset generates trajectories with shape [Bx2x...]
# To sample a batch of trajectories from the replay buffer, we can either use the get_next() method,
# which returns the batch of trajectories plus a BufferInfo object that contains the sample
# identifiers and their sampling probabilities. 
# Or the as_dataset method which is a tf.data.Dataset. This way, we can benefit from the power of 
# the Data API (e.g., parallelism and prefetching).  
dataset = replay_buffer.as_dataset(
    num_parallel_calls=3, 
    sample_batch_size=batch_size, 
    num_steps=2
    ).prefetch(3)

'''
Random (Data) Collection
------------------------
The algorithm must prime the pump. Training cannot begin on an empty replay buffer. 
The following code performs a predefined number of steps to generate initial training data.
'''
random_policy = random_tf_policy.RandomTFPolicy(train_env.time_step_spec(),
                                                train_env.action_spec())

  # generate a trajectory
  time_step = environment.current_time_step()
  action_step = policy.action(time_step)
  next_time_step = environment.step(action_step.action)
  traj = trajectory.from_transition(time_step, action_step, next_time_step)
  # Add the trajectory to the replay buffer
  buffer.add_batch(traj)

# collect some data with a random policy
def collect_data(env, policy, buffer, steps):
  for _ in range(steps):
    collect_step(env, policy, buffer)

collect_data(train_env, random_policy, replay_buffer, steps=initial_collect_steps)

'''
Training the agent
------------------
Now that we have pump some data to the replay buffer we'are ready to train the DQN. 
This process can take many hours, depending on how many episodes you wish to run through. 
As training occurs, loss and average return will be updated. 
As training becomes more successful, the average return should increase. 
The losses reflect the average loss for individual training batches.

Two things must happen during the training loop:
  - collect data from the environment
  - use that data to train the agent's neural network(s)
